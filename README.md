# SR Remake in React

---

Hyper Island - First Webb App

### :open_file_folder: The Brief:

We started the module of by creating a website using the Sveriges Radio API in vanilla Javascript etc. In this project I had to recreate the that project into React <a href="https://github.com/birkkensen/SR-radio-remake">Link to the first project</a>


### :hourglass_flowing_sand: Time spent / Deadline:

6 weeks (3 weeks for the React part)

### :dart: Goals:

Since this was my first React project I just wanted to get comfortable with the basics.
- Understand how regular JS/HTML/CSS translates into React
- Get comfortable with React basics, read the documentation.
- Learn how to use hooks and props.
- Write readable and maintainable code.
- Create an easy to navigate file / folder structure.

### :grimacing: The process:

It took me some time to get used to breaking everything up into smaller components. Passing props up and down the hierarchy I also found a bit tricky in the beginning. I had to spend a lot of my time reading the documentation and watching tutorials to get a hang of it all.

My biggest struggle was (and still is) towards the end of the project trying to get the radio to play on IOS devices using Safari, which is a thing I haven't been able to fix yet. I at least got it working on Safari for desktops.


### :blue_book: Learnings:

- Learned even more about Sveriges Radios API, and APIs in general
- A foundation in React a can keep working on
- More JS knowledge, as well as HTML and module based CSS
- The mobile first approach
